        <p>As a graduate of the Academy of Interactive Entertainment, I have enhanced my knowledge of game programming. From my experience at AIE, I am proficient in Unity and Unreal Engine. I was also a part of AIE's Ambassador Program, which has helped me gain more skills in leadership.</p>

        <p>I work very well in team-based environments due to the various projects I have worked on throughout my school career and my 12 years of work experience.</p>
            
        <p>I am confident in my ability to be a strong contributing member of a game programming team. I hope to make beautiful and fun games for gamers like me to enjoy</p>
